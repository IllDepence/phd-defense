# PhD Defense

Slides used in my [PhD thesis](https://github.com/IllDepence/phd-thesis) defense.

## Tech

#### Usage

* `$ latexmk -pdflatex presentation.tex`\*
* or manually
    * `$ pdflatex presentation.tex`
    * `$ biber presentation`
    * `$ pdflatex presentation.tex`
    * `$ pdflatex presentation.tex`


\*Without specifying `-pdflatex`, LuaTeX is called, which leads to unintended fonts being used.


#### Background

* LaTeX
    * used **SDQ Presentation Template**
        * [uni access](https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/kastel/sdq/dokumentvorlagen/praesentationen/beamer)
        * [public access](https://sdq.kastel.kit.edu/wiki/Dokumentvorlagen#LaTeX_Beamer) (see Overleaf link)
    * removed all uni logos, links, etc. (for consistency with the PhD thesis handed in for examination, which is not allowed to feature any uni logos)
* Tools
    * illustrations created in **Inkscape**

## Content

#### General

Reflects the contents of my [PhD thesis](https://github.com/IllDepence/phd-thesis), with a merry maritime metaphor mixed into the intro. â›µ&#xFE0E;

#### Principles &amp; Preferences

* stick to permissively licensed material (pictograms, icons, etc.) to use in illustrations
* focus on key points in the main slides; details and minor goodies can be discussed and mentioned later
* have plenty of backup slides ready
